# C10

If we let 
$$
A = 
\begin {bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
the characterstic equation can be found such that
$$
(\lambda I - A)v =0
$$
In our case, that means
$$
(\lambda I - A)v =
\begin {bmatrix}
\lambda - 1 & 2 \\
3 & \lambda - 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Then, we compute the determinant 

$$
\det\begin {bmatrix}
1-\lambda & 2 \\
3 & 4-\lambda
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Whch is 
$$
(1-\lambda)(\lambda-4)-2(3) = 0\\
\lambda^2-5\lambda-2 = 0
$$

otherwise known as the characteristic polynomial. The reason it is called the **characteristic** equation is because the eigenvalues of a matrix are the linearly independent vectors that span the space of $R^n$.
